            <p> HI!
                <br>
                <br>

                We are Josie and Hollie and thanks for visiting Plenty Full ! Our company started out as <br> a small hobby between the two of us in our uni flat. We started posting pictures of our food <br>we were creating onto instagram. Slowly we started to grow a small following and by <br> the time we were graduating we realised we could turn our small hobby into a full time job <br> if we tried our hardest. We started small, creating a free to download e-book slowly <br> building up to where we are now.
                <br>
                <br>
                The purpose of the workshops are to show people just how much variety is <br> out there when it comes to vegetarian food and we wanted the opportunity <br> to share that with everyone.
                <br>
                <br>
                So wether you are vegetarian and hunting for recipes, wanting to learn how to <br> cooker you are just trying to find a sweet snack, we just want <br>to say thanks for coming to our small site and we hope you enjoy.
                <br>
                <br>
                Joise & Hollie</p>
